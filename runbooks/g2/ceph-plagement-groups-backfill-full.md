# Ceph Placement Groups Backfill Full

**Initial runbook version.**

## Problem

Placement Groups are used for mapping objects to specific resource pools.
Backfill TooFull state means: "A backfill operation is waiting because the destination OSD is over the backfillfull ratio".

This is probably a problem with Ceph object storage daemon.
