# Node Memory Issues

**Initial runbook version.**

## Problem

Triggered by [EDAC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Error_detection_and_correction#LINUX-EDAC) metrics. Linux is capable of correcting some missing/unreadable bits in RAM. Too many defects become uncorrectable error.

High error rate usually signifies end-of-life hardware.

## Analysis
 * [Maybe some commands from here](https://github.com/mollypi/handbook/blob/master/how-tomd/how_to_identify_defective_dimm_from_edac_error_on_.md)

## Resolution
 * Replace RAM
